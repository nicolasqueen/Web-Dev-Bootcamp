<h2>This is My First Article</h2>

<p class="firstParagraph">WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT! You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. Professor, make a woman out of me. I don't want to be rescued. I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!</p>

<p>Tell them I hate them. So, how 'bout them Knicks? No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh... also, comes with double prize money.</p>

<p>Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. And then the battle's not so bad? The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.</p>

<h2>This is Another Article</h2>

<p class="firstParagraph">It must be wonderful. I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead finger. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?</p>

<p>Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates... PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon. It's toe-tappingly tragic! I wish! It's a nickel. For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored.</p>

<p>Daddy Bender, we're hungry. I'm a thing. A true inspiration for the children. A true inspiration for the children. Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. Also Zoidberg. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him. Noooooo! It's a T. It goes "tuh". Professor, make a woman out of me. It's toe-tappingly tragic! Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Noooooo!</p>
