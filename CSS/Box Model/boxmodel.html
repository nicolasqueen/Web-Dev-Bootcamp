    <p>When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film! Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg!</p>
    <p>All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit... that's why I'm transferring to business school! In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms. I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians.</p>
